# Q1. What is Statistics?

#  Statistics is the science of collecting, organising and analyzing data.
#     

# Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.
There are two types of statisics 
1.Descriptive 
2.Inferential 
1.Descriptive :-
    Measure of frequency
    Measure of dispersion(variance, and standard deviation)
    Measure of central tendency(Mean, Median , Mode)
    Measure of position
2.Inferential :-
    ANOVA
    chi-square etc
# Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of
# each type of data.
There are 2 types
Quantitative data and Qualitative data
Quantitative data :-Data is depicted in numerical terms. Can be shown in numbers and variables like ratio, percentage, and more.Example: 100%, 1:3, 123
Qualitative data:-Data is not depicted in numerical terms. Could be about the behavioral attributes of a person, or thing. Example: loud behavior, fair skin, soft quality, and more.   Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:
(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E
(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red
(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...]
(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...]quantitative :-(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...]
        (iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...]
qualitative :-(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E
(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, redQ7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.Nominal:-Nominal data is defined as the data used for naming or labeling variables, without any quantitative value.
    Used to collect data of people, places, or things.
    There is no quantitative value associated with variables. It is a qualitative measure.
    Equality
    example :-Sex (male and female) 
ordinal:-Similar to nominal data, ordinal data is categorical data with an order.
    Used to collect feedback, reviews, or ratings.
    Quantitative values are attached to ordinal variables, but you can’t conduct arithmetic calculations.
    ex:-Customer Satisfaction Rating (on a scale 0 – 5)Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?Line Graph
Bar Graph
Pie Chart
Histogram
Dot Graph
Scatter plot
Bubble chart

# Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each
# type of statistics and explain how they are used.

There are two types of statisics 
1.Descriptive 
2.Inferential 
1.Descriptive :-
    Measure of frequency
    Measure of dispersion(variance, and standard deviation)
    Measure of central tendency(Mean, Median , Mode)
    Measure of position
2.Inferential :-
    ANOVA
    chi-square etc
    
1.Descriptive :-It gives information about raw data which describes the data in some manner.
    It helps in organizing, analyzing, and to present data in a meaningful manner.
    It is used to describe a situation.
    It explains already known data and is limited to a sample or population having a small size.
    It can be achieved with the help of charts, graphs, tables, etc.
    
2.Inferential :-It makes inferences about the population using data drawn from the population.
    It allows us to compare data, and make hypotheses and predictions.
    It is used to explain the chance of occurrence of an event.
    It attempts to reach the conclusion about the population.
    It can be achieved by probability.
